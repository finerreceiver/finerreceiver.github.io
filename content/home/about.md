FINER (Far-Infrared Nebular Emission Receiver) is a dual-polarization sideband-separating superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) mixer receiver for [the Large Millimeter Telescope](http://lmtgtm.org/) (LMT) in Mexico. By exploiting the [ALMA](http://www.almaobservatory.org/)'s new wideband sensitivity upgrade (WSU) technology, FINER covers a wide range in radio frequencies from 120−350 GHz, with an instantaneous intermediate frequency (IF) of 4−20.5 GHz per sideband per polarization, providing 40% of ALMAʼs light-collecting area, a similar atmospheric transmittance to ALMA, and a 5 times wider bandwidth than ALMA, which offers the highest spectral scanning capability in the northern hemisphere.
