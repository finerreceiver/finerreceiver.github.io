## Hardware system overview
FINER consists of two SIS receivers.

### Optics
Single beam.

### Front-end receiver
The front-end receiver exploits the high critical current density SIS mixer technology (Kojima et al. 2017, 2020) for ALMA 2 (future ALMA), which allows us to have a wide instantaneous frequency coverage.

### Back-end spectrometer
Digital spectrometer (DRS4, ELECS Inc.). Analog IF input is digitized by a set of 3-bit 20.48 GSa/s analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), each of which offers a 10.24 GHz bandwidth with a 20 MHz spectral resolution.

High-resolution spectroscopy is offered by the array of 2.5-GHz digital spectrometers, XFFTS (RPG).
